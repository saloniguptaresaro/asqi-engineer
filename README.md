ASQI (AI Solutions Quality Index) Engineer helps teams test and evaluate AI systems. It runs containerized test packages, automates scoring, and provides durable execution workflows.

The project focuses first on chatbot testing and supports extensions for other AI system types. [Resaro][Resaro] welcomes contributions of test packages, score cards, and schemas.

## Key Features

### **Modular Test Execution**

- **Durable execution**: [DBOS]-powered fault tolerance with automatic retry and recovery
- **Concurrent testing**: Parallel test execution with configurable concurrency limits
- **Container isolation**: Each test runs in isolated Docker containers for consistency and reproducibility

### **Flexible Scenario-based Testing**

- **Core schema definition**: Specifies the underlying contract between test packages and users running tests, enabling an extensible approach to scale to new use cases and test modules
- **Multi-system orchestration**: Tests can coordinate multiple AI systems (target, simulator, evaluator) in complex workflows
- **Flexible configuration**: Test packages specify input systems and parameters that can be customised for individual use cases

### **Dataset Support and Data Generation**

- **Input datasets**: Feed evaluation datasets, source documents, or training data to test containers
- **Dataset registry**: Centralized dataset definitions with reusable configurations across test suites
- **Multiple formats**: Support for HuggingFace datasets, PDF documents, and text files
- **Column mapping**: Align dataset fields with container expectations for seamless integration
- **Synthetic data generation**: Generate training data, augment datasets, or create RAG question-answer pairs
- **Output datasets**: Containers can produce datasets as outputs for data pipeline workflows

### **Automated Assessment**

- **Structured reporting**: JSON output with detailed metrics and assessment outcomes
- **Configurable score cards**: Define custom evaluation criteria with flexible assessment conditions
- **Metric expressions**: Combine multiple metrics using mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison operators (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`), boolean logic (`and`, `or`, `not`), conditional expressions (`if-else`), and functions (`min`, `max`, `avg`, `abs`, `round`, `pow`) for sophisticated composite scoring including hard gates patterns
- **Technical reports**: Enable test containers to generate `html` and `pdf` reports that provide detailed analysis and evidence for quality indicator assessments

### **Developer Experience**

- **Type-safe configuration**: Pydantic schemas with JSON Schema generation for IDE support
- **Rich CLI interface**: Typer-based commands with comprehensive help and validation
- **Real-time feedback**: Live progress reporting with structured logging and tracing

## AI System Testing

ASQI Engineer supports comprehensive testing across multiple AI system types including `llm_api`, `rag_api`, `image_generation_api`, `image_editing_api`, and `vlm_api` (vision-language models). This enables testing of traditional LLM APIs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with contextual retrieval capabilities, image generation and editing models, and multimodal vision-language systems. We have also open-sourced a draft ASQI score card for customer chatbots that provides mappings between technical metrics and business-relevant assessment criteria.

### **LLM Test Containers**

- **[Garak]**: Security vulnerability assessment with 40+ attack vectors and probes
- **[DeepTeam]**: Red teaming library for adversarial robustness testing
- **[TrustLLM]**: Comprehensive framework and benchmarks to evaluate trustworthiness of LLM systems
- **[Inspect Evals]**: Comprehensive evaluation suite with 80+ tasks across cybersecurity, mathematics, reasoning, knowledge, bias, and safety domains
- **[LLMPerf](https://github.com/ray-project/llmperf)**: Token-level performance benchmarking for latency, throughput, and request metrics
- **Resaro Chatbot Simulator**: Persona and scenario based conversational testing with multi-turn dialogue simulation

The supported system types use OpenAI-compatible API interfaces, or in the case of `rag_api`, a superset of it. Through [LiteLLM] integration, ASQI Engineer provides unified access to 100+ LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, and custom endpoints. RAG systems additionally require responses with contextual citations for retrieval-augmented evaluation. This standardisation enables test containers to work seamlessly across different AI providers while supporting complex multi-system test scenarios (e.g., using different models for simulation, evaluation, and target testing).

## Quick Start

Get started with ASQI Engineer in 3 simple steps:

### Requirements

- **Python 3.12+** is required
- Docker for running test containers
    > **Note:** If you are facing issues detecting your Docker daemon, you might need to set the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable in your `.env` file. See `.env` for details.

**1. Install the package:**

```bash
pip install asqi-engineer
```

**2. Run the setup script:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asqi-engineer/asqi-engineer/main/setup.sh | bash
```

This downloads all required configuration files and creates a `.env` template.

**3. Configure and run:**

```bash
# Start the services and run your first test:
docker compose up -d
asqi execute-tests -t config/suites/demo_test.yaml -s config/systems/demo_systems.yaml

# Or generate synthetic data (if you have data generation containers):
asqi generate-dataset -t config/generation/suite.yaml -s config/systems/demo_systems.yaml -d config/datasets/registry.yaml
```

This short flow should download a demo test container and generate the test results in `output.json`. Now, to actually test your AI system, configure the `.env` file and try out the other test packages in: https://www.asqi.ai/quickstart.html

## Contributing & development

We keep contributor-facing documentation split into two focused documents so each file stays concise and actionable.

Quick actions:

- To see how to contribute (PR process, templates, commit guidance), open [CONTRIBUTING.md].
- To get your dev environment ready and run tests locally (venv, `uv` commands, and devcontainer), open [DEVELOPMENT.md].
- Example configs and test containers live under `config/` and `test_containers/` respectively.

If you're unsure where to start, read [CONTRIBUTING.md] first for the workflow and then follow the setup steps in [DEVELOPMENT.md] to run the test suite locally.
